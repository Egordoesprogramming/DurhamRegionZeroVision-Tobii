# DurhamRegionZeroVision-Tobii
In response to the serious danger posed by distracted driving, CityStudio Durham, an innovation hub located in Durham, has committed to reducing distracted driving related accidents to zero. To this end, they have reached out to me, a student in the University of Ontario Institute of Technologyâ€™s capstone course, to be a part of their efforts. I was asked to apply my program knowledge of game development towards creating a virtual reality serious game. The goal for this serious game is to serve as a way to study, and increase awareness of, distracted driving, particularly when it comes to commercial signage. As a result I have developed Distracted Drivers, a driving simulator based on Simcoe Street North, from its intersection with Taunton Road to its intersection with Conlin Road. My hardware solution implements TobiiSDK plugin for Unity. In particular, this allows us to make use of the Tobii eye tracker 4c as my development and testing platforms. TobiiSDK was chosen as it is more accessible and gives the opportunity for developers to deploy their prototype directly to Unity.

This is a fully working version of the simulator, so if you have a Tobii eyetracker 4C go ahead a TRY IT OUT! The game can be played on keyboard, Xbox/PS4 controller, and Pico controllers. Check out User Manual for more details!
